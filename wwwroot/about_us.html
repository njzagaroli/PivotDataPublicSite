                            Kelli Brown is an attorney with more than 20 years of experience in the private fund industry, including time spent in the tax 
                            consulting practices of Ernst & Young and PricewaterhouseCoopers.  In 1999 she joined Bowman Capital Management, a multi-billion 
                            dollar hedge fund and private equity adviser, as Special Counsel.  In 2002, she joined forces with a group of Bowman colleagues to 
                            found Cavalry Asset Management, where she was General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer, client relations liaison and tax director.  
                            The need to juggle various roles during this time led Kelli to leverage technology resources to become as efficient as possible.  
                            In 2006, she co-founded Sol Hedge, LLC, a consulting firm, on the premise that technology should be utilized to the maximum extent 
                            possible to minimize manual error and improve back-office efficiency.  This quest led to the development of a more comprehensive and user 
                            friendly compliance application to handle multiple regulatory filing requirements including Form PF, CPO-PQR, ADV, AIFMD, 13F and investor 
                            reporting.
