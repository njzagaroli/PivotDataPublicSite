                                We are experts in creating data warehouse solutions for the family office market, and currently work 
                                with some of the largest family offices in the country.  We can provide a package of solutions that 
                                include:
                                <ul class="main">
                                    <li>Pre-built and custom ETL processes</li>

                                    <li>Financial Reporting capabilities</li>

                                    <li>Seamless integration with other reporting and analytic applications</li>
                                </ul>
                            <p>
                                PivotData has developed a set of reports focused on family offices covering multi-generational, as 
                                well as complex family structures and entity ownerships. All reports can be generated at the family 
                                level, the individual level, or the entity level.

                                Financial reports provide family members and management with a consolidated picture of their wealth 
                                holdings, allowing them to make fully informed decisions about their future.  Studies show that on 
                                average a manager of a family office spends over 30% of their time creating the quarterly and annual 
                                reports for the various family members.  Most of the time this work involves the extraction of data from 
                                various databases and applications, and then using another set of applications, along with Excel 
                                spreadsheets, to cobble together the necessary reports.

                                PivotData’s Cash Flow Forecasting module provides family offices with the ability to manage and 
                                predict cash flows for all types of investments, including alternative investments such as private 
                                equity and real estate transactions. Our cash flow module will enable you to model current and future 
                                investments, taking into account different events such as changes in distributions, or a change in a

                                PivotData’s Cash Flow Forecasting Module allows family offices to automate waterfall calculation processes 
                                and scenario forecasting capabilities using multiple hurdle rate scenarios. Coupled with our data warehouse 
                                solution, our Cash Flow Forecasting Module will allow you to report cash flow forecast for any entity or ownership 
                                structure.
